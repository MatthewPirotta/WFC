Wave Function Collapse
========================

# About the Project

This project implements the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm in Unity using a tile grid approach. All tile assets were hand-designed using custom pixel art created specifically for this system.

To enhance the flexibility and reduce the number of handcrafted tiles required, I developed a multi-layer approach. This custom method allows for more complex and varied outputs while minimizing the need to manually design a large number of individual tile combinations. It balances visual diversity with development efficiency, making the system more scalable for larger or more detailed environments.
