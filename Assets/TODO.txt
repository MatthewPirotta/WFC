BUG:
- On the top layer, consider three 3 tiles in a column. The bottom is air, the top is plank_UD, leaving no valid tile for to collapse.
- The UD plank are touching each other from the left and right. Put a block edge type that doesnt allow neighbors. This would be mean that the 'air' block would aslo be block/empty?
- Get Null reference error when using unity inspector to collapse nodes, after inspecting non related objects?
- If there is a half generated world, WFC just autocompletes it when reluanching Unity?

##Refactoring:
- action delegate
- Make code cleaner
- reducing all my public properties -_-
- Most of debug script doesnt need to be called if running collapse all
- make use of ref keyword
- acutally incoroporate getNeighbors function found in MyGrid class
- Subrcibe events	onEnbale and onDisable
- privat instances should start with "_"

##Maintainability
-Unit tests?
-Docfx documentation and class diagrams
-Make the pipeline process of importing a spritesheet and setting values simplier

##Expand the project
-dark water tile
-World as list instead of 2d Array?
-Reduce small patches; Smoothing algorhtims, flood fill
-Tiles can have an OR for accepted bordering configurations
-Create palm trees for top grid sprite. In general (multiple sprites to make one large sprite)

##Outside feature scope
-Pre seeding
-Using DOTS, for parallelisation. (ECS? data driven approach)
-Auto sample the tile to figure out the edge connection type
-Biomes
-generate in blocks

##Honestly have no idea
-Dual grid
-dynamically generate the sprite/mesh
-Tile connections be indepent of bordering
-Automatically extract mirroring and symettry, to reduce num of tiles
